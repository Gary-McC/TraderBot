USE INSTRUCTIONS FOR RL AGENT TRAINING
--backtest.py
  -backtest.py is the script used for backtesting and evaluating the RL agent model
  -Ensure backtest.py is in the same folder or project as the agent you are training, as it is imported into the agent training program
  -DO NOT ADJUST
  
--LSTM RL.py
  -LSTM based RL agent that learns to trade using deep Q learning
  -How to use:
    -Open program, adjust file path to point to listed data file.
    -Ensure backtest.py is in the same folder or project as the agent you are training, as it is imported into the agent training program
    -Run program
    -WARNING: Program is not verbose, and may take awhile to train. Let it run, it will yield an output eventually.
   
-- Transformer RL.py
    -Transformer based RL agent that learns to trade using deep Q learning
  -How to use:
    -Open program, adjust file path to point to listed data file.
    -Ensure backtest.py is in the same folder or project as the agent you are training, as it is imported into the agent training program
    -Run program
    -WARNING: Program is not verbose, and takes a very long time. Let it run, it will yield an output eventually. May take an excess of 60 hours if run on local machine GPU.
