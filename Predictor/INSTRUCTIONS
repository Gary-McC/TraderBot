INSTRUCTIONS:
Files:
-One-Year-Trainer: generates predictive model of input price data, predicting the price 5 minutes ahead, originally meant to be trained on one year of data.
	-To use: Download file and a file from Data folder. 
	-Ensure path to data file is correct in file name
	-Other parameters adjustable for experimentation
	-Run file

-Daily-Predictor: Uses premade predictive model from One-Year-Trainer to cross train on most recent data and predict today's values. 
Currently trains on previous two weeks of data.
	-To use: Download program file and ensure premade model is available for cross-training purposes
	-Put path to cross training model in Modelname
	-Ensure parameters are similar to those in One-Year-Trainer when model was generated for best results
	-Run file

-One-Year-Trainer-Offset: generates predictive model of input price data, predicting the price 24 hours ahead.
	-To use: Download file and a file from Data folder. 
	-Ensure path to data file is correct in file name
	-Other parameters adjustable for experimentation
	-Run file

-Daily-Predictor-Offset:Uses premade predictive model from One-Year-Trainer-Offset to cross train on most recent data and predict tomorrow's values. 
Currently trains on previous two weeks of data.
	-To use: Download program file and ensure premade model is available for cross-training purposes
	-Put path to cross training model in Modelname
	-Ensure parameters are similar to those in One-Year-Trainer-Offset when model was generated for best results
